=================================
Transformations: Python Evaluator
=================================

Plugin to use Python code to write an ETL Transform.

Introduction
-----------
Executes user-provided Python code that transforms one record into another.
Input records are converted into Python dictionaries which can be directly accessed
in Python code. "Python" in this context is `Jython <http://www.jython.org>`__, a Java-implementation of Python.
The transform expects to receive a JSON object as input, which it will
convert back to a record in Java to pass to downstream transforms and sinks.

Use Case
--------
The Python Evaluator transform is used when other transforms cannot meet your needs.
For example, you may want to multiply a field by 1024 and rename it from ``'gigabytes'``
to ``'megabytes'``. Or you might want to convert a timestamp into a human-readable date string.

Getting Started
===============

Following are instructions to build and deploy hydrator transform plugins.

Prerequisites
-------------
To use plugins, you must have CDAP version 3.2.0 or later. 
You can download the CDAP Standalone SDK that includes Hydrator `here <http://cask.co/downloads>`__.

Build Plugin
------------
You can get started with the CDAP-plugin by building directly from the latest source code::

  git clone https://github.com/caskdata/hydrator-plugins.git
  cd hydrator-plugins
  mvn clean package -pl python-evaluator-transform -am

You can build without running tests by using::

  mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl python-evaluator-transform

After the build completes, you will have a JAR for the plugin under the
``python-evaluator-transform/target/`` directory.

Deploy Plugin
-------------
You can deploy the transform plugin using the CDAP CLI::

  cdap > load artifact python-evaluator-transform/target/python-evaluator-transform-<version>.jar \
         config-file python-evaluator-transform/target/python-evaluator-transform-<version>.json


Known Issues
============
The PythonEvaluator transform has a memory leak which affects the CDAP SDK. 
Running it multiple times from within the same JVM in the CDAP SDK will result in an 
OutOfMemoryError: PermGen Space (https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-4222).
